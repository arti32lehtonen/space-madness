# Readme

Some of the assets cannot be shared due to the license terms.
They were replaced by the generic images created by myself
with a analogous color and shape. 

Below, I provide the information about the original assets. 
If you want to get the build with original assets,
you need to download them and replace files in the corresponding folders.
